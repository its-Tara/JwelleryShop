This project is part of my learning journey in CSS and bootstrap.
It was created as part of a course/tutorial to reinforce fundamental concepts and gain hands-on experience in designing.
Through this project, I strengthened my understanding of bootstrap and gained practical experience in designing. It allowed me to apply theoretical knowledge to real-world scenarios, enhancing my problem-solving abilities.
Feel free to explore the code and provide feedback. I'm always eager to learn and improve!
